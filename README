maintains a jump-list of directories you actually use
old directories eventually fall off the list
inspired by Joel Schaerer's http://wiki.github.com/joelthelion/autojump
and something similar i had - but i could never get the dir list right.

INSTALL:
  source into .bashrc under your '[-z "$PS1" ] || return' line
  cd around for a while

USE:
  j [--h[elp]] [--r] [--l] [regex1 ... regexn]
                      with no args, returns full list (same as j --l)
    regex1 ... regexn jump to the most used directory matching all masks
    --l               show the list instead of jumping
    --r               order by recently used instead of most used. (If this 
                      option is used, it must be the first option.)
